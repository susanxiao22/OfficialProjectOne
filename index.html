    <h2>This Week's Blend: Rosebud Tea</h2>
    </div>

  <div class="text">
    <h3>Origin and Ancient Use</h3>
    <p class= paragraph-one>China has a profound association with roses and their use in tea. The practice of brewing rose tea can be traced back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), known as a golden age for Chinese poetry, arts, and culture. It was during this time that the Chinese began infusing dried rose petals with green tea, black tea, or herbal blends, creating a delightful and fragrant beverage. Rose tea gained popularity not only for its taste but also for its therapeutic effects. Traditional Chinese medicine recognized rose tea as a cooling and calming drink that could help balance the body's energy, promote healthy digestion, and relieve emotional stress and anxiety. It was also believed to enhance beauty and promote youthful skin.</p>
    
    <h3>Modern-Day Rose Tea</h3>
    <p class="paragraph-two">Today, rose tea continues to be cherished worldwide for its soothing aroma, delicate flavor, and potential health benefits. It is often made by steeping dried whole rose flowers or rose petals in hot water, allowing the fragrant essence to infuse into the liquid. Rose tea can be enjoyed on its own or blended with other teas or herbal ingredients to create delightful and aromatic blends.</p>
    
    <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
    <p class="paragraph-three">Apart from its enticing taste and aroma, rose tea is known for its potential health benefits. It is believed to possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which can help combat oxidative stress, promote healthy skin, and support the immune system. Rose tea is also considered a natural diuretic and is sometimes used to relieve menstrual cramps and support urinary tract health. In addition, the calming properties of rose tea can help relax the mind, reduce anxiety, and promote restful sleep. Its gentle and soothing nature makes it a popular choice for those seeking moments of tranquility and self-care.</p>
