      <h2>This Weeks' Blend: Rosebud Tea</h2>

    </div>
  <h3>Origin and Ancient Use</h3>
  <p>China has a profound association with roses and their use in tea. The practice of brewing rose tea can be traced back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), known as a golden age for Chinese poetry, arts, and culture. It was during this time that the Chinese began infusing dried rose petals with green tea, black tea, or herbal blends, creating a delightful and fragrant beverage. Rose tea gained popularity not only for its taste but also for its therapeutic effects. Traditional Chinese medicine recognized rose tea as a cooling and calming drink that could help balance the body's energy, promote healthy digestion, and relieve emotional stress and anxiety. It was also believed to enhance beauty and promote youthful skin.</p>
